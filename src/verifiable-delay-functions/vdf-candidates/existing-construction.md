## A Survey of VDF Constructions

In this section, we study several well known candidates for VDF constructions. These include: the construction of Dwork and Naor {{#cite DN92}}, the construction of Pietrzak {{#cite Pie19}} and Wesolowski {{#cite Wes19}}, and the isogeny based construction of de Feo et al {{#cite FMPS19}}. Then we compare these constructions. Finally, we discuss a possible construction based on incremential verifiable computation {{#cite BBBF18}}.
