# Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)

Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) was introduced in 2018 and has become an active research aera in cryptography. VDF has many applications in blockchains, such as randomness beacon, resource-efficient blockchain, computational timestamping, etc. 

In this chapter, we first give a brief overview of VDF, then study and discuss several existing VDF constructions.
