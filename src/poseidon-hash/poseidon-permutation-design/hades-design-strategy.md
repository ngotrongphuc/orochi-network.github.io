# Hades design strategy

## Overview
In \\(\mathsf{Hades}\\), they mix rounds with ***full SBox layers*** and rounds with ***partial SBox layers***. They want to strike the balance between:
+ Full layers are ***expensive*** in software and ZK proof systems, but ***well resists*** statistical attacks.
+ Partial layers are ***computationally cheap***, but often serves as good as full ones against algebraic attacks.

## Details

The Hades design strategy receives input a state \\(S=(S_1,S_2,\dots,S_t)\\) and consists of \\(R_f\\) initial rounds, in which SBoxes are applied to the *full state*. After these \\(R_f\\) rounds, \\(R_p\\) partial rounds in the middle contain *a single SBox for each round*, and the rest of the state goes through the nonliner layer ***unchanged*** (you can say that the rest goes through the identity functions \\(f(x) = x\\)). Finally, \\(R_f\\) full rounds at the end are applied again:
$$R_f \longrightarrow R_p \longrightarrow R_f$$

An overview of the construction of the permutation can be described in the figure below:

## The round function

As in the figure, in each round, several functions (illustrated as the blocks) are applied to the state \\(S\\) to transform it into a new state \\(S'\\), these functions are called **round functions**. Each round function consists of \\(3\\) components:
+ \\(AddRoundConstants\\), denoted by \\(ARC(\cdot)\\): essentially an addition of the state with a random constant. 
+ \\(SubWords\\), denoted by \\(SBox(\cdot)\\) or \\(SB(\cdot)\\). This is simply the SBox substitution.
+ \\(MixLayers\\), denoted by \\(M(\cdot)\\). This is the ***linear layer*** of the construction. It involves multiplication between the state and a \\(t \times t\\) ***MDS(Maximum Distance Separable) matrix***. This is used to apply the ***wide trail strategy*** (explained in {{#cite DJRV01}}) which helps provide arguments against statistical attacks.

Note that: we can use the same number of full rounds instead of partial rounds in the construction without decreasing the security. However, this leads to significantly higher computation costs in our applications.

## Maximum Distance Separable

A matrix \\(M \in \mathbb{F}^{t \times t}\\) is called ***maximum distance saparable (MDS)*** iff it has a branch number \\(\mathcal{B}(M) = t + 1\\). The branch number of \\(M\\) is defined as \\(\mathcal{B}(M) = min_{x \in \mathbb{F}^t}\\{wt(x) + wt(M(x))\\}\\) where \\(wt\\) is the ***Hamming weight*** in wide trail terminology. 

Equivalently, a matrix \\(M\\) is MDS iff **every submatrix of \\(M\\) is non-singular** (a non-singluar matrix is a matrix whose determinant is not \\(0\\)). This definition is easier to understand.

There will be a construction of these matrices in later sections, because we do not need regular MDS matrices, but ***secure*** MDS matrices.
