# Cryptographic sponge functions

\\(\mathsf{Poseidon}\\) is a sponge-based cryptographic hash function, so it is neccessary to understand the design of such hash functions to understand the components of \\(\mathsf{Poseidon}\\). In this section, we look at the definitions and design of a sponged-based cryptographic hash function, before showing its applications in hash functions and other problems.

In 2007, the sponge construction was introduced by Guido Bertoni and others {{#cite BDPA08}}.

A ***sponge construction*** or ***sponge function*** takes input bit data of *arbitrary* length (called a ***message***) and outputs bit data of *fixed* length (called a ***hash digest***). In the context of a sponge function, we can say that the message is ***absorbed*** to the sponge, and the digest is ***squeezed*** out.

A sponge construction hash \\(2\\) ***phases***:
+ ***Absorb***: the message is compressed iteratively.
+ ***Squeeze***: the digest is extracted iteratively.

Below is the construction of a sponge function:

1. The first component (the leftmost) is the ***state memory*** \\((S)\\) and it is divided into \\(2\\) parts: the ***Bitrate*** part \\((R)\\) of size \\(r\\) and the ***Capacity*** part \\((C)\\) of size \\(c\\). \\(S\\) is initially set to \\(0\\), and we denote the initial state as \\(I\\): $$I = 0^r || 0^c.$$
2. The second component is the ***compress function \\(f\\)*** whose input and output are of the same length. \\(S\\) is updated whenever passing the compress function.
3. The third component is the ***padding function*** \\(pad\\) which increases the size of the ***message \\(M\\)*** to a suitable length (specifically, the length of the padded message is a multiple of bitrate \\(r\\)).
4. The squeeze phase takes the Bitrate of \\(S\\) as output parts, before going to the compress function \\(f\\). The final output: \\(Z = \\{ Z_0; Z_1;...\\} \\). If the length of \\(Z\\) is not a multiple of \\(r\\), it will be truncated.

# Applications of cryptographic sponge functions

Sponge functions have both theoretical and practical uses. In theoretical cryptanalysis, a **random sponge function** is a sponge construction where \\(f\\) is a *random permutation or transformation*, as appropriate. Random sponge functions capture more of the practical limitations of cryptographic primitives than does the widely used random oracle model, in particular the *finite internal state* {{#cite BDPA08}}.

The sponge construction can also be used to build practical cryptographic primitives. For example, \\(\mathsf{Keccak}\\) cryptographic sponge with a \\(1600\\)-bit state has been selected by NIST as the winner in the \\(\mathsf{SHA-3}\\) competition. The strength of \\(\mathsf{Keccak}\\) derives from the intricate, multi-round permutation \\(f\\) developed by its authors. The \\(\mathsf{RC4}\\)-redesign called \\(\mathsf{Spritz}\\) {{#cite RS16}} refers to the sponge-construct to define the algorithm.

In {{#cite GKRRS21}}, they introduced \\(\mathsf{Poseidon}\\) hash function that uses the cryptographic sponge function as its architecture with the compression function \\(f\\) being the permutation \\(\mathsf{Poseidon}^\pi\\).
