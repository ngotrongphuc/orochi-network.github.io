## Unlocking the Web3 Universe: Orochi Network's Oracle Service

Imagine building a Web3 application that thrives on real-world data, free from centralized control. This is the vision behind Orochi Network's Oracle service, a powerful tool poised to revolutionize the way DApps interact with the external world.

Traditionally, DApps have struggled to access external data sources, relying on centralized oracles â€“ single points of failure susceptible to manipulation and bias. Orochi's Oracle shatters these limitations, offering a decentralized, secure, and versatile solution for feeding accurate and verifiable data into your DApps.

```bash
npm i --save-dev @orochi-network/contracts
```

## Oracle Aggregator Overview

This section describes all methods of Oracle V1 that facilitate interaction from external smart contracts. To familiarize yourself with Oracle V1, the following terminology definitions may be helpful.

**appId:** Application ID on Oracle, our oracle support multiple applications there are two of them listed here:

| Application ID | Description      |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | Asset Price      |
| 2              | Cross Chain Data |

**round:** Each application will have different round number, every time a new dataset submitted the round number will be increased by 1

**identifier:** Data identifier, it's a `bytes20` used to index data on smart contract, for asset price application `identifier` is token's symbol

**Note:**

- _Only 255 latest rounds will be cached on smart contract, you can not get more than 255 rounds from the current round by using `getData()` method_
- _Round is uint64, so 2^64 is the limit of number of round_

### Summary:

- This contract defines an interface for interacting with an oracle aggregator.
- It provides functions to retrieve application metadata, data, and round information.
- It's designed for read-only access, as all functions are marked as view.

### Key Points:

The IOrocleAggregatorV1 interface defines several methods:

- `request(uint256 identifier, bytes calldata data)`: This function is used to create a new request. It takes an identifier and data as parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether the request was successful.
- `fulfill(uint256 identifier, bytes calldata data)`: This function is used to fulfill a request. It also takes an identifier and data as parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether the fulfillment was successful.
- `getMetadata(uint32 appId, bytes20 identifier)`: This function is used to get the metadata of a given application. It takes an application ID and an identifier as parameters and returns the round and the last update time.
- `getData(uint32 appId, uint64 round, bytes20 identifier)`: This function is used to get the data of an application for a specific round. It takes an application ID, a round number, and an identifier as parameters and returns the data.
- `getLatestData(uint32 appId, bytes20 identifier)`: This function is used to get the latest data of an application. It takes an application ID and an identifier as parameters and returns the data.
- `getLatestRound(uint32 appId, bytes20 identifier)`: This function is used to get the latest round of an application. It takes an application ID and an identifier as parameters and returns the round number, the last update time, and the data.

## Example

Here is an example of `AssetPrice` consumer:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import '@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol';
import '@orochi-network/contracts/IOracleAggregatorV1.sol';

contract ConsumerAssetPrice is Ownable {
  IOracleAggregatorV1 private oracle;

  event SetOracle(address indexed oldOracle, address indexed newOracle);

  constructor(address oracleAddress) {
    _setOracle(oracleAddress);
  }

  function _setOracle(address newOracle) internal {
    emit SetOracle(address(oracle), newOracle);
    oracle = IOracleAggregatorV1(newOracle);
  }

  /**
   * Get price of an asset based USD
   * @dev Token price will use 18 decimal for all token
   * @param identifier Asset identifier (e.g. BTC, ETH, USDT)
   * @return price
   */
  function _getPrice(bytes20 identifier) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return uint256(oracle.getLatestData(1, identifier));
  }

  /**
   * Get price of a pair
   * @dev Token price will use 18 decimal for all token
   * (e.g. BTC/ETH => srcToken='BTC' dstToken='ETH')
   * @param srcToken Asset identifier of source
   * @param dstToken Asset identifier of destination
   * @return price
   */
  function _getPriceOfPair(bytes20 srcToken, bytes20 dstToken) internal view returns (uint256) {
    return (_getPrice(srcToken) * 10 ** 9) / (_getPrice(dstToken));
  }

  /**
   * Allow owner to set new Oracle address
   * @param newOracle new Oracle address
   * @return success
   */
  function setOracle(address newOracle) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
    _setOracle(newOracle);
    return true;
  }
}
```

Here is an example of `BitcoinSeller` that used `ConsumerAssetPrice`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import './ConsumerAssetPrice.sol';

contract BitcoinSeller is ConsumerAssetPrice {
  constructor(address provider) ConsumerAssetPrice(provider) {}

  function estimate(uint256 amount) external view returns (uint256 total) {
    total = _getPrice('BTC') * amount;
  }

  function ethOverBtc() external view returns (uint256 price) {
    price = _getPriceOfPair('ETH', 'BTC');
  }
}
```
