# Distributed Storage Engine

This chapter provides a comprehensive insight into the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and its components, explaining how data is replicated and retrieved in the network using unique identifiers like PeerID and CID. It dives deep into concepts like IPNS, which provides a permanent pointer to mutable data, and Merkle DAG, a data structure essential for data storage and retrieval in IPFS. [IPFS](./ipfs.md).

Next we describe the functionality and implementation of a Storage Engine, particularly focusing on the IPFS Storage Engine. [Storage Engine](./storage-engine.md).
