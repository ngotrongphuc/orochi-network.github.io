## DKG Construction 
In this chapter, we describe the DKG protocol in the paper Gennaro et al {{#cite GJKR99}}. The protocol can withstand up to \\(\dfrac{n}{2}\\) dishonest participants, where \\(n\\) is the number of participants. Despite the high communication cost, the protocol only need to be executed once in the first round of many threshold cryptosystems, making the DKG communication cost is not a serious matter in these cryptosystems.
