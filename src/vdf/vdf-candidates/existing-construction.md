## Existing VDF Constuctions

In this section, we study well known candidates for VDF constructions. These include: the construction of Pietrzak {{#cite Pie19}} and Wesolowski {{#cite Wes19}}, the isogeny based construction of de Feo et al {{#cite FMPS19}} and a possible construction based on verifiable computation {{#cite BBBF18}}.
